# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting house prices using a linear regression model. The code is implemented in Python and utilizes various libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

## Libraries Used

- `numpy`: Library for numerical operations.
- `pandas`: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`: Data visualization library.
- `seaborn`: Data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
- `sklearn.pipeline`: Function for creating a machine learning pipeline.
- `sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer`: Class for handling missing data.
- `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`: Class for linear regression modeling.

## Data Files

- `train.csv`: CSV file containing the training data.
- `test.csv`: CSV file containing the test data.

## Prediction

- The prediction may not be be accurate but would be near to it.
